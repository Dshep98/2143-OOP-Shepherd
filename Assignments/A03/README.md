## Assignment #3 Frequency Ananlysis Substitution Cipher
### Dominique Shepherd
### Description:

In this assignment were given an intial frequency analysis chart of letters that occur most in thr english text. Then were given two text to decipher using 
substitution of the frequency analysis given and the one from both of the cipher text provided. From there we were to compare the to and substite the letters with the repective frequencies.

### Instructions

- This project was compiled using repl.it python compiler. I didn't run it anywhere else so im not entirely sure if it will work the same as with repl.it.

- Profesor Griffin: 
 - Sugesstion was to compare the top three frequencies of both charts and start substituting from there, to see what words would be formed.
  I used the sources to help me understand what how to decipher both cipher text, and to actually comprehend how the material was supposed to work.

### Problems
- Once i applied the methods some words were still not coming together so is used the book and start changing three/Two letter words to the most common words 
words in the english dictionary like and,the, or,to,etc.
- After that i still had problems so i started to use the deciphered text i found online with the ciphered text i was given and kept changing letters around until 
 it formed the word i needed.
 - it likely wasn't the best solution but it helped some.
