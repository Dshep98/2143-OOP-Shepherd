## Assignment #3 Frequency Ananlysis Substitution Cipher
### Dominique Shepherd
### Description:

In this assignment were given an intial frequency analysis chart of letters that occur most in thr english text. Then were given two text to decipher using 
substitution of the frequency analysis given and the one from both of the cipher text provided. From there we were to compare the to and substite the letters with the repective frequencies.

### Instructions

- This project was compiled using repl.it python compiler. I didb't run it anywhere else so im not entirely sure if it will work the same as with repl.it.

I used the sources to help me understand what how to decipher both cipher text.
