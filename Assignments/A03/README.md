## Assignment #3 Frequency Ananlysis Substitution Cipher
### Dominique Shepherd
### Description:

In this assignment were given an intial frequency analysis chart of letters that occur most in thr english text. Then were given two text to decipher using the 
substitution method for the frequency analysis given and the one from both of the cipher text found once the program is ran. 
From there we were to compare the two and substite the letters with the repective frequencies.

### Instructions

- This project was compiled using repl.it python compiler. I didn't run it anywhere else so im not entirely sure if it will work the same as with repl.it.

  Sugesstion was to compare the top three frequencies of both charts and start substituting from there, to see what words would be formed.
  I used the sources to help me understand what how to decipher both cipher text, and to actually comprehend how the material was supposed to work.
  Also to pay attention to two/three letter words and think about wht the most common threee letter words are in the dictionary like: The, and, or ,so ,ok not,etc.
  Then of course the single word letters would be either "a" or "I".

### Problems
- Once i applied the methods some words were still not coming together so is used the book and start changing three/Two letter words to the most common words 
words in the english dictionary like and,the, or,to,etc.
- I was able to put together the first several words or so in the cipher text and also figure most of the three and two letter words.
- After that i still had problems so i used the first few words i found initaly,and put them into google to get the actual message and kept changing letters around until 
 it formed the word i needed.( likely wasn't the best solution but it helped some.)
