## Assignment 5: Vigenere Cipher
### Dominique Shepherd

#### FORE WARNING: This program is incompleteand still in progress everything here is just what I have so far

### Description:
- This program uses the vigenere cipher, the files given are already encryted using this method. TO decrypt it you have to use a dictionary to find the length of the key
  and to narrow that process down you implent something called the incidence of coincidence, and that gives you an estimate of what the key length is. From there you run a frequency anaylisis and compare that with the incidence of coincidence to narrow down the length of the possible key in the dictionary. 

### Files

|   #   | File                       | Description                                                |
| :---: | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [main.py](./main.py)     | solution file with everything in it.                         |
|   2   | [words.txt](./words)| dictionary used to find keyword        |
|   3   | [ciphertext](./ciphertext)| encrypted text       |


### Instructions

- This project was compiled using repl.it's python3
- I am not sure if its safe to be ran anywhere else.
