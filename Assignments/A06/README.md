## Assignment 6: Prime Factor
### Dominique Shepherd

#### FORE WARNING: Is complete the the reading of the prime has to be fixed

### Description: This program reads in numbers from a file to determine if their prime or not. If a number is prime the program should print prime and if not print the factors of the number.

### Files

|   #   | File                       | Description                                                |

|   2   | [num.txt](./num.txt)|Big number input file  |
|   3   | [input.dat](./input.dat)| small number input file      |
|   4   | [output.txt](./output.txt)| holds the output produced from both the small number and big number files      |


### Instructions

- This project was compiled using repl.it's c++
- I am not sure if its safe to be ran anywhere else.
### Sources
- 

### Problems
- Figuring out the factors once the prime numbers were found was a problem, because I'd get it to print one of the factors
  initally but nothing else would print. So then I switched it to print just "i" instead of "num".
  
 - Once I combined the code for primes and composites there was a problem with the primes. As shown below
- Number 1: 2-Factors:  Prime
  Number 2: 3-Factors:  Prime
  Number 3: 4-Factors:  2,
  Number 4: 5-Factors: 
  Number 5: 6-Factors:  2, 3,
  Number 6: 7-Factors: 

- Its printing the factors and the first two primes but not the rest for number 4 &6.
