## Assignment 7: Primality Research
### Dominique Shepherd

### Description: This assignment was to find different algorithms that relate to primality testing in the forms of deterministic, certification, amd compositeness.

### Problems
- One of the problems I encountered with this was the understanding of the math being applied on certain ones.
- COnceptually it was a bit hard trying to understand what the test are doing with the impleentation of it as code
- I had trouble kind of putting the summaries of each soucre in words so I did the best I could.
