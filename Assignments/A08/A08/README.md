## Assignment 8 - Public Key Encryption
#### Dominique Shepherd

### Introduction

This project will use an existing python library called cryptography (appropriately named) to use public key encryption to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between two entitiesr. Using a library called Flask, we can do that. A Flask server runs and "listens" or monitors a "port" on a computer.
