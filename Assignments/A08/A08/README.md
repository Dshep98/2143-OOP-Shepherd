## Assignment 8 - Public Key Encryption
#### Dominique Shepherd

### Overview

This project will use an existing python library called [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/index.html) (appropriately named) to use public key encryption to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between two entities. We need a method to allow two scripts to "talk" or communicate over a network. This means NOT on the same computer.  Using a library called Flask, we can do that. A Flask server runs and "listens" or monitors a "port" on a computer. When requests are directed to that port either from an internal request or an external request, they are handled by the process monitoring the port, or in our case Flask. 


There is a client/server on A and a client/server on B. Notice that the clients don't talk to their own servers! Why? They don't need to. Each process is local and can simply read or write from the local file system to communicate. However, each client does communicate with the server on the other machine.
